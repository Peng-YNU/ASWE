# A Tensorflow implement of "Adversarial Learning of Sentiment Word Representations for Sentiment Analysis"
This is a Tensorflow implement of the proposed in paper "Adversarial Learning of Sentiment Word Representations for Sentiment Analysis"


## Requirements
  1. Python 3.6
  2. Tensorflow 1.10 (<2.0)
  
  
## Dataset
  Sentiment140 (Divided into two files, one contains positive sentences and the other contains negative sentences)

  The training datasets and our results can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gt9hZR6zAwoTWmsd2uaquw (Extraction code: 6nv6). (Github传大文件太慢了,在下懒了)
  
  
## Evaluation
  - Word-level: https://github.com/mfaruqui/eval-word-vectors
  
  - Sentence-level: https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval
  
  
## Reference
  - https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/word2vec/index.html
  - https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py
